I go by `at` or `DataKinds` online. You can check out my homepage, where I write longer-form content, here: https://datakinds.github.io/. I have a few other accounts across the web where I post longer-form content as well, I challenge you to find them.

I code up language interpreters and creative projects. I reach for Haskell and various APLs as my preferred choice of tool. Yes, the warranty I gave you _did_ eat your dog. It was a cat? I couldn't tell from the fluff left over. I'm sorry -- that just happens sometimes. 

I litter my code comments with haikus. You should try to find some of them. Better yet -- you should send me some haikus. Click one of the contact links in that there left pane to do so.
